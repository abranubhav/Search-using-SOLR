# Search-using-SOLR
To show the use of APACHE SOLR,  a fast and efficient search software

The SOLR is indexed with a dataset called 20-Newsgroup dataset. You can find the dataset and details about it at https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Twenty+Newsgroups

A new collection called Newsgroups is created in the SOLR UI and the searches are done on it.

The ipnyb(Jupyter Notebook) shows how to use SOLR for simple querying.
